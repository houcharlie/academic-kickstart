# Biography

I'm a senior at Princeton University.  At school, I work on separate research projects advised by [Yuxin Chen](http://www.princeton.edu/~yc5/) and [Miklos Racz](http://mracz.princeton.edu/).  Articles I write will be placed in my own blog or in a group research [blog](https://kaledivergence.github.io/) that I've started with a few others.

I like writing fiction, which will be under posts.  I also like [cooking](https://houcharlie.github.io/stories/).
