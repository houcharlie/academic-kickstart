### Current Projects

* [Professor Miklos Racz](http://mracz.princeton.edu/) and I are working on new algorithms and theoretical guarantees for retrieving temporal information from graphs.
* [Professor Yuxin Chen](http://www.princeton.edu/~yc5/) and I are working on analyzing the optimization landscape of simple ResNets.  


### Past Projects

* [Hrishikesh Khandeparkar](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~hrk/index.html), [Gene Li](https://gxli97.github.io/), and I worked on a project studying the effect of additional depth on deep learning.

* Some friends and I used posts from a subreddit as signal to trade stocks.  The results are in this [repository](https://github.com/houcharlie/WallStreetBets).
